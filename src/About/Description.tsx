            <p>I'm Fabian â€” frontend developer and photography lover.</p>
            <p>Photography is my way of capturing the balance between nature and myself. 
            I focus mainly on landscapes, architecture, and quiet details that often go unnoticed.</p>
            <p>This website is both a personal collection.
            I designed and coded it myself as part of my portfolio.</p>
            <p>Hope you enjoy the photos :)</p>
